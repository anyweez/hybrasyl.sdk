## How to contribute to the Hybrasyl Project

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by looking on the Hybrasyl Project JIRA for the [SDK project](https://hybrasyl.atlassian.net/projects/SDK/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a GitHub issue first](https://github.com/hybrasyl/sdk/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* Before submitting, please note that you must agree to the [Hybrasyl Project Contributor Agreement](https://github.com/hybrasyl/server/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) in order for us to accept your PR.

#### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

* Suggest your change in the [hybrasyl-devel mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/hybrasyl-devel) and start writing code.

* Do not open an issue on GitHub until you have collected positive feedback about the change. GitHub issues are primarily intended for bug reports and fixes.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask any question about Hybrasyl in the [hybrasyl-users mailing list](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!forum/hybrasyl-rails).
